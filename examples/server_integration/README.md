# Server integration

A demonstration of sharing data structures between client and server when using
a Rust backend. This reduces duplication. Also provides examples of a simple get request.
 Uses Rocket for the backend.
 
 To run, from this directory, run `cargo +nightly run`, and from the `frontend`
 subdirectory, run the build script and dev server as you would normally.
